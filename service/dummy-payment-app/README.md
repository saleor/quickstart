### What is Dummy Payment App?

The Dummy Payment App allows you to test Saleor's payment and checkout features without needing to set up a real payment provider. You can create orders, process payments, issue refunds, and more, all within the Saleor Dashboard.

### App features

- Create new checkouts and orders from the Saleor Dashboard:

> [!TIP]
> Each Transaction has `externalUrl` that links to this page from Order details page in Saleor Dashboard:

- Issue refunds, process charges and cancellations for Transactions

### How does it work?

The Dummy Payment App supports the following webhooks to enable payment flows:

The app implements webhooks to process payments initiated from your storefront:

- `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_INITIALIZE_SESSION`
- `TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE_SESSION`
- `TRANSACTION_PROCESS_SESSION`

It also implements webhooks to allow updating the status of Transactions from the Saleor Dashboard, similar to how a real third-party payment provider would:

- `TRANSACTION_REFUND_REQUESTED`
- `TRANSACTION_CHARGE_REQUESTED`
- `TRANSACTION_CANCELATION_REQUESTED`
